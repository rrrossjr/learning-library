#  Multitenant Workshop setup

## OCI cloud account

This Lab uses Linux server with Oracle Software from Oracle Marketplace. We can get to this image by logging into Oracle Cloud.  The Lab is self driven and can the done in the following ways.

- Using Always Free account
- Using Your Oracle Cloud account


#### Always Free Account
If you are using the always free account, the free account gives access to Autonomous database and one OCPU VM server. For more information check out the  **[link](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/FreeTier/resourceref.htm)**. on how to get it.

#### Oracle Cloud Account
If you already have Cloud Account, then you will already have tenant name, username and password needed to login and provision a workshop server.


------------------------------------------------------------------------



## Generate an SSH Key Pair

If you already have an ssh key pair, you may use that to connect to your environment. Based on your laptop config, choose the appropriate step to connect to your instance.
For for information check out the **[link](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/blob/master/common/labs/generate-ssh-key/generate-ssh-keys.md)**.
 The link also describes how to connect to Linux server once its provisioned. We will need to revist this once we have provisioned the SSH keys.

That is it. We have successfully create a Multitenant Workshop Instance.
Check out the IP address of the provisioned server and ssh to it.
If you need help to configure client from Mac or Putty client to this server, please check the **[link](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/blob/master/common/labs/generate-ssh-key/generate-ssh-keys.md)** if you need help.

The default user is "opc" and accessed by ssh private key. It does not have a password.

## Connecting to workshop instance using Putty
1.  Open the PuTTY utility from the Windows start menu.   In the dialog box, enter the IP Address of your OCI Compute Instance.  This can be obtained from the **OCI Console > Instance Details** screen.

2.  Under **Category** select **Connection** and then choose the **Data** field.  Enter the assigned username.  OCI instances will default to the username ```opc```.  Enter ```opc```.

3.  Under **Category**, navigate to **Connection** - **SSH** and choose the **Auth** category.   Click on the **Browse** button and locate the ```Private Key file``` you created in the earlier step.   Click the Open button to initiate the SSH connection to your cloud instance.

6.  Connection successful.   You are now securely connected to an OCI Cloud instance.

    ![](images/keylab-027.png " ")

    You are now able to connect securely using the Putty terminal utility.   You can save the connection information for future use and configure PuTTY with your own custom settings.

## Connect from Mac
1. Run the following command to change the file permissions to 600 to secure the key. You can also set them to 400.

````
 chmod 600 labkey.ppk
 ````
2. Use the key to log in to the SSH client as shown in the following example, which loads the key in file labkey.ppk, and logs in as user to IP Address.
````
ssh -i lapkey.ppk orace@192.237.248.66

````
## Run the Setup Scripts as oracle
if you connected with username  opc, then sudo to oracle user.
````
sudo su - oracle
````
